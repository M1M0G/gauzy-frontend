<br>

This is a basic frontend template project to use as starting point to build something or to just test stuff. It has been done in a reasonably vanilla way to see how everything works under the hood and to allow to configure the necessary.

<br>

The tech stack is:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)
- [React](https://reactjs.org)
- [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web)
- [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com)
- [webpack](https://webpack.js.org)
- [Babel](https://babeljs.io)
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io)

<br>

To use it, you can fork, clone, or generate a repo from this template, download it into your computer, run `yarn install` to install the required dependencies, and then `yarn start` to start the development server at `localhost:8080`.

To create a production build, run `yarn build`, and to serve a production build, run `yarn serve`, which will be available at `localhost:4040`.

<br>

Also, feel free to contribute if you think something can be improved in any way.

Happy coding ‚ö°
